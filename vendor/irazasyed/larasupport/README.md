> Laravel Support for Lumen: Adds missing helpers that are not being made to the core of Lumen. Lets you use Laravel Packages in Lumen.
>
> There are some helper functions that are available in core of Laravel framework which are being used in Laravel Packages. Now because of these helpers missing in core of the Lumen, You won't be able to use those amazing Laravel Packages.
>
> I had submited PRs as well as created issue tickets in Lumen to add these helpers to the core but it got rejected with a reason to use Laravel instead. Just for Packages support i didn't want to use full-stack framework. There were few discussions about the same as well. Hence, This package to deal with this issue!
